sent privs appear with own nick. solve
   should appear with target nick
   and all selfs should be another color
   and like #chan self message...
   maybe do @target self message...


check :

!! rendering should be independent from data
! that being said, message formatting is already done at some level
! ^ think about this

abstract functions like privSend, ...
^ code must be more modular

test

remove some TextShow instances which were only useful for debugging, like Flag
